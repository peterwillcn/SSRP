Todo:

    -   Figure out which files need to be rewritten and which are fine.
    -   Go though the dependencies and rebuild the makefile based on includes
        statements. (makedepend can do this)
    -   Split up the graphGroup module into seperate modules. (on-going)
    -   Replace journeyGroup with vector<journey>

Changes:

Version 0.02:

    - Reformated the makefiles to use makedepend.

Version 0.01:

    -   Split off graphGroup's input and output functions into a new module.
    -   Split off the random number generator functions into a new module.
    -   Changed the string representation of infinity to the unicode character
        for infinity, rather than -1.
    -   Separated the sources into a tree directory structure and updated the
        makefile accordingly.
