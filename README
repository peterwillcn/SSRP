Changes:

Version 0.03:

    -   Added more input/ouptput functions
    -   Cleaned up the main function in test.cpp
        We should probably write our own one of these.
    -   Added debugging at compile time.
        To use it, enable the -DDEBUG option to g++,
        or just change CXXFLAGS in Makefile.inc
    -   Added the ability to print graphs in pdf format.
        The format can be changed by changing the graphFormat option in ioFunctions.cpp

Version 0.02:

    - Reformated the makefiles to use makedepend.

Version 0.01:

    -   Split off graphGroup's input and output functions into a new module.
    -   Split off the random number generator functions into a new module.
    -   Changed the string representation of infinity to the unicode character
        for infinity, rather than -1.
    -   Separated the sources into a tree directory structure and updated the
        makefile accordingly.
