SSRP Manual for Developers:

This document contains information that should be helpful to developers who are
trying to alter the project in some way.

Background:

Before working on any part of this project, familiarize yourself with the
following algorithms and graph theory terms:

Graph Theory Terms:
    Graph
    Minimum Spanning Tree
    Journey
    Path

Shortest Path Algorithms:
    Dijkstra's Algorithm
    Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms:
    Prim's Algorithm

The following programming tools are in use by the project, and any developer
should have a good understanding of them:

C++
C++ STL
GNU make

`GNU makedepend` is used by the project to create dependency trees for `GNU
make`. Familiarity with this tool would be helpful.

The following tools are used in the command-parser, but familiarity with them is
only necessary for altering that particular part of the project:

GNU bison
GNU flex

(If you want to learn bison or edit the command parser, you must be familiar
with Context-Free Grammar's first!)
