This Version:

    -   Separated the sources into a tree directory structure and updated the
        makefile accordingly.

Todo:

    -   Figure out which files need to be rewritten and which are fine.
    -   Go though the dependencies and rebuild the makefile based on includes
        statements. (makedepend can do this)
    -   Split up the graphGroup module into seperate modules.
    -   Replace journeyGroup with vector<journey>

Splitting up graphGroup:

    -   Take out input/output operations and wrap them into a seperate module.
    -
